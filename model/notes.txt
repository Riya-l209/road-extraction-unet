Road Extraction from Satellite Images - Model Architecture Notes


Model Overview:

- The task is to segment road areas from satellite images.
- A semantic segmentation model is used to label each pixel as road or background.
- The most commonly used architecture for this task is U-Net, due to its ability to learn spatial features efficiently.

Why U-Net?

- U-Net is designed for biomedical image segmentation but works well on satellite images.
- It uses an encoder-decoder structure:
  - Encoder (Contracting Path): Captures context using convolution and max pooling.
  - Decoder (Expanding Path): Performs upsampling and concatenation with encoder features.
- Skip connections help retain spatial information, crucial for precise road extraction.

Input/Output:

- Input: RGB satellite image (e.g., 256x256x3).
- Output: Binary mask of the same spatial dimension (e.g., 256x256x1), where:
  - 1 = Road
  - 0 = Background

Loss Function:

- Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) for pixel-wise classification.
- Dice Loss or IoU Loss is often added for better overlap performance.
- Example combined loss:
  Loss = BCE + DiceLoss

Metrics:

- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- F1-Score (Dice coefficient)
- Pixel Accuracy
