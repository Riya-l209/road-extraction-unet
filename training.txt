MODEL TRAINING

 Loss- a no that tells how wrong the model's prediction is- inversely proportional- high loss mean bad prediction

	(a) Binary Cross Entropy(BCE) Loss- used for binary classification (road vs non-road per pixel).
	   -> formula: BCE=-[y*log(p) + (1-y)*log(1-p)]
	   -> Expected O/P- Target (ground truth): 1 (road)
		            Model output (predicted prob): 0.95 → Good → Low loss
			    Model output: 0.1 → Bad → High loss
	   -> deviation means under-detecting roads (false neg) OR over-predicting roads(false positive)
	   -> easy to implement
	   -> fails when data is class-imbalanced
	   -> here will not give good results as data is class imbalance
	   


	(b) Dice Loss - used for handling class imbalance
	    -> formula : 1 - (2 * |X ∩ Y|) / (|X| + |Y|)
	    ->  focuses on overlap- helps learn road shapes better.
	         -> Expected O/P- large overlap predicted b/w road region and actual road region
			     Dice coefficient = 1 → Perfect match (loss = 0)  
			     Dice coefficient = 0.6 → Partial match (loss = 0.4)
	    -> deviation mean partial prediction, narrow roads or road boundaries not matched exactly 
	    -> sensitive to shape mismatch (like even if pixels predicted correctly in quantity, but location is wrong)	



	(c) Combined Loss (BCE + Dice)- used for balancing pixel accuracy and overall shape (good default).
	      -> formula : Combined = α * BCE + (1 - α) * Dice  (here in this project α=0.3)
	      -> Expected O/P- Pixel-wise accuracy (from BCE) AND Region-wise overlap and shape match (from Dice)
			       Loss = 0.3 * BCE + 0.7 * Dice
	      -> deviation mean failing to predict roads pixel-perfectly (BCE fails) OR predicting disconnected or broken roads (Dice fails)

	      ->will work better here as covers pixel-level and structural-level errors.

			      

	(d) Jaccard Loss (IoU Loss) - used for optimizing the IoU metric directly.
	     -> formula: 1 - (|X ∩ Y| / |X ∪ Y|) 
	     -> can use it for advanced evaluation
	     -> -> Expected O/P- High intersection over union of predicted and actual road area.
			       IoU = 1 → Perfect overlap → loss = 0  
			       IoU = 0.3 → Weak overlap → loss = 0.7
	      -> deviation mean low area match - either predicting too much (over-segmentation) or too little (under-segmentation) OR boundary mismatch, missing parts
	      -> If wrongly predict extra roads → IoU decreases (penalized)
		 If miss real roads → IoU also decreases



BASED ON OUR REQUIREMENT COMBINED(BCE + DICE) IS THE BEST FIT FOR CALCULATING LOSS 
ALSO NEED TO TRACK EVALUATION METRICS(IoU, F1) 

Precision = True pos/ true pos + false pos
Recall = true pos / true pos + false neg
F1 score = harmonic mean of precision and recall
