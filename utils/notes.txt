Hi, I am Harshita— Visualizer & Tester 

I will be working on visualizing the results of the model — overlaying the predicted road masks onto the original satellite images, and creating clear visual outputs to show model accuracy.

Topics I read today (Day 2):
- What is matplotlib:
  Matplotlib is a Python library used to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations. We will use it to display our images and road masks.

- What is image overlay:
  Overlay is combining two images — in this project, we will overlay the road prediction (mask) on top of the satellite image to see which roads were detected by the model.

- What is Grad-CAM (brief reading):
  Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a technique to visualize where the model is "looking" in an image when making a prediction — we will explore using Grad-CAM later to understand how our U-Net identifies roads.

Goals for my role in the project:
✅ Write scripts to plot image and mask overlays  
✅ Write visualization functions to evaluate model outputs  
✅ Explore Grad-CAM for U-Net if possible
