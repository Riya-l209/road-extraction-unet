# Deployment Notes

## What is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use web framework written in Python. It is commonly used to turn machine learning models into web applications by providing a RESTful API to interact with the model.

### Key Features:
- Minimal and flexible framework
- Built-in development server and debugger
- RESTful request dispatching
- Integrated support for unit testing
- Can be easily combined with tools like Gunicorn or Docker for production deployment

### Why Flask for ML Deployment?
- Easy integration with Python-based ML models
- Quick to set up REST APIs for model prediction
- Suitable for prototyping and small-scale production use
