 What is Patching in Image Preprocessing?

Patching is the process of dividing large images into smaller, fixed-size parts called "patches." 
This is often done during preprocessing in computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation.

 Why we use  Patching?
- To reduce memory usage
- To make training faster
- To help the model learn better local features
- To allow training on GPUs with limited memory

 Example:
If you have an image of size 512x512 pixels, you can break it into four 256x256 patches.
This way, you can process smaller chunks of the image one at a time.

 How it's used:
Patching is especially useful for training models like U-Net, which need to work on smaller regions 
of large satellite or medical images.

ðŸ“Ž Bonus:
Sometimes, overlapping patches are used to reduce edge artifacts and improve accuracy.
